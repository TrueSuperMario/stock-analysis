</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The Betashares Active Australian Hybrids Fund (HBRD) has shown a year-to-date return of approximately 6%, benefiting from a recovery in the Australian equities market and stable performance of hybrid securities. Earnings growth reflects consistent income generation through dividends from its hybrid security holdings, although specific earnings data for the fund hasn't been publicly disclosed as it's managed rather than an individual company.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The fund's profit margin is not directly applicable as it manages a portfolio of hybrid securities, but it typically aims for a yield that is competitive compared to traditional fixed income. Given prevailing interest rates, the fund seeks to deliver returns in line with expectations set by the performance of hybrid investments, usually characterized by higher yields than standard bonds.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Since HBRD is a managed fund, EPS is not a relevant metric. Instead, the focus is more on the distribution yield and income generated through its diversified portfolio of hybrid securities.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Similar to EPS, ROE is not a typical measure for funds. Instead, the focus should be on the total return versus benchmark performance. The fund has historically performed reasonably well against its benchmarks, which reflect a strong active management strategy.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>

<strong>-  Valuation Benchmarking:</strong>
