    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<p>The valuation of Qantas can be gauged through several key metrics:</p>
<p>1. **P/E Ratio**: Currently, Qantas trades at a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 12. This valuation appears attractive compared to the industry average, suggesting potential undervaluation or optimism about future growth.</p>

<p>3. **Competition**: Competitive pressures from both domestic and international carriers continue, but Qantas retains a strong brand and loyalty program, providing a buffer.</p>

    <h3>General Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<p>Investor sentiment regarding Qantas is cautiously optimistic. While there are concerns about ongoing cost pressures and potential economic slowdowns, the broader outlook for the travel sector remains positive. The return of business travel and international tourism is expected to support continuing growth.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
