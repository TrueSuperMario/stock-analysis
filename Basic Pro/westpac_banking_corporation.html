    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>As of March 2025, Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC) has reported revenue growth of 3% year-over-year, driven mainly by a rise in housing and personal loans alongside moderate growth in business lending. Earnings growth, however, has lagged slightly at 2%, primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and increased operating costs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<p>Westpac's net profit margin stands at approximately 20%, which remains competitive within the Australian banking sector. Despite the competitive landscape, the bank has managed to sustain its margins through cost control measures and improved operational efficiency.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The current EPS for Westpac is $1.50, reflecting a marginal increase of 1.5% from the previous year. This slow growth indicates stable performance, although it demonstrates the challenges the bank faces in optimizing profitability in a competitive environment.</p>
