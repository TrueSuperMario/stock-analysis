<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>GrainCorp Ltd has observed a year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 6%, driven by increased grain production in Australia and heightened global demand for agricultural commodities. Earnings growth, however, has been more muted at around 3%, as margins have been under pressure from rising input costs and logistical challenges.</p>
