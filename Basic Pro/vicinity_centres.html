<body>
    <ul>
<h3>Current Performance</h3>
<li>**Revenue and Earnings Growth:**</li>
<p>Vicinity Centres (VCX) has displayed a modest 3% year-on-year revenue growth, largely driven by stable rental income from its portfolio of shopping centres and increased foot traffic post-COVID-19 restrictions. However, earnings have been flat due to rising operational costs and increased investment in maintenance.</p>
<li>**Profit Margins:**</li>
<p>The net profit margin stands at 12%, indicating a stable profitability despite the challenging retail environment. Cost control measures have been instrumental in maintaining this level of margin amid rising operational expenses.</p>
<li>**Earnings Per Share (EPS):**</li>
<p>EPS is currently at $0.18, which is unchanged from the previous year. This reflects a steady performance but also highlights the challenges in driving significant earnings growth in the current retail landscape.</p>
<li>**Return on Equity (ROE):**</li>
<p>VCX’s ROE is 7%, reflecting moderate efficiency in using shareholders’ equity to generate profits. This is consistent with typical metrics in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, though there is room for improvement.</p>
