<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Yancoal Australia Ltd (YAL) has reported strong year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 15% for the most recent fiscal period, primarily fueled by increased coal prices and robust demand from key export markets. However, earnings growth reflects a more modest increase of 8%, as operational costs have escalated due to higher input costs and logistical challenges.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
