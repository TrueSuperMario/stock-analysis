    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Vanguard Australian Shares INDEX ETF (VAS) has shown consistent growth year-on-year with a revenue increase driven by strong inflows into passive investments, reflecting a broader trend of investors seeking low-cost, diversified exposure to the Australian equity market.

<strong>-  Net Asset Value (NAV):</strong>
<p>As of 2025-03-03, VAS’s NAV has shown a slight upward trend, currently at AUD 100, suggesting resilient performance amid market fluctuations. It closely reflects the performance of the underlying ASX 300 index, which itself has been performing positively.</p>
