</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Vanguard Australian Shares INDEX ETF (VAS) has shown strong revenue growth over the past year, aligning closely with the overall performance of the ASX 300 index. Year-on-year, the fund has experienced growth of approximately 8%. Earnings have been supported by a recovery in the Australian equity market, particularly in sectors such as finance and materials.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Since VAS is an index fund, profit margins are not typically reported like individual companies. However, the fund's management expense ratio (MER) is approximately 0.10%, indicating efficient cost management and low operational expenses relative to the assets under management (AUM).</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Given that VAS represents a diversified portfolio rather than a single company's performance, EPS is not applicable. Investors are instead concerned with the distribution of returns via dividends.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>ROE is not applicable for VAS as it is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) composed of numerous equities; hence, it does not directly calculate its ROE.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The current P/E ratio for the underlying assets of VAS is approximately 15, a figure that suggests the fund is fairly valued compared to historical averages for the Australian market.</p>
