    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Dexus (DXS) has experienced a 7% year-on-year revenue growth driven by increased demand for its properties, particularly in the industrial and office sectors. Earnings growth has been modest at approximately 3%, impacted by rising operational costs and a challenging economic environment.</p>
