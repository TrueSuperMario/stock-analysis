</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Vanguard US Total Market Shares INDEX ETF (VTS) has experienced a strong performance over the past year, with revenue growth attributed predominantly to the overall positive trends in the US equity markets.
