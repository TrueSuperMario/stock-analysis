The company is engaged in the production of metals and mining, with key commodities including aluminum, copper, and nickel.</p>
<p>The company's recent quarterly earnings report has shown a modest increase in revenue driven by higher metal prices, although production disruptions in certain regions have raised concerns.

    <h3>Insider Activity</h3>
<p>Insider trading activity for SOUTH32 has shown a mix of selling and buying:</p>
