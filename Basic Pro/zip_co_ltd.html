</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>ZIP Co Ltd has demonstrated a year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 15%, bolstered by an increased demand for buy now, pay later (BNPL) services amid rising consumer credit needs.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
