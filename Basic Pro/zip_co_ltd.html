<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q3 2024, ZIP Co Ltd has reported a notable revenue increase of 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong customer acquisition and usage growth in its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) segment.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The net profit margin for ZIP is approximately 2%, indicating thin profitability margins common in the BNPL sector. The company has been investing heavily in technology and marketing to capture market share, which has somewhat diluted margins in the short term.</p>
