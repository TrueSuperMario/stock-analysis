<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Growthpoint Properties Australia (GOZ) has reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 4%, driven primarily by a strategic focus on operational efficiency and diversification of its property portfolio. However, earnings growth has lagged at about 2%, reflecting increased property management expenses and operating costs amid rising interest rates.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
