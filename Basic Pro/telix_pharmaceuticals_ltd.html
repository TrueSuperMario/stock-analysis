</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Telix Pharmaceuticals Ltd has reported a significant revenue growth of 40% year-on-year, attributed to increased sales of its radiopharmaceutical products and expanded market presence, particularly in oncology. However, earnings have shown a more modest increase of 15%, impacted by rising research and development costs as the company accelerates its clinical trial programs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's net profit margin is currently at -12%, reflecting substantial investment in R&D and market expansion efforts. While this negative margin emphasizes the company’s investment phase, it is typical for biotech firms in their growth stages.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
