<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>RIO Tinto Ltd has reported a revenue decline of approximately 10% year-on-year due to decreased demand for iron ore and coal, which are its primary products. Earnings have also contracted, reflecting both falling commodity prices and operational challenges in some mining locations.</p>
