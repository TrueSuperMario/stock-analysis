</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>The a2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M) has reported a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by a resurgence in demand for a2 protein-related products and strong growth in international markets. However, earnings growth is more subdued at 4%, primarily due to rising production costs and inflation impacting margins.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>A2M’s net profit margin currently sits at 12%, which reflects the company's continued ability to maintain profitability despite challenges in sourcing dairy. However, this margin has tightened compared to the previous year, indicating elevated costs.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The EPS is reported at $0.58, marking a modest increase from $0.55 in the prior year. This reflects A2M's consistent sales growth, although it underscores profit pressures due to increasing input costs and competition.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
