</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>The A2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M) has reported a decline in revenue over the last fiscal year, with total revenue decreasing by approximately 12% year-on-year. The primary driver of this decline has been reduced sales in the China market, where demand for premium dairy products has fluctuated significantly. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) dropped by about 15%, reflecting both lower sales and increased costs associated with procurement and distribution.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>A2M's net profit margin currently stands at 8%, a slight decrease from 10% previously. The squeeze on margins is attributed to higher input costs and competitive pricing pressures in the infant nutrition segment, one of A2M's primary revenue sources.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The company reported an EPS of $0.30, down from $0.38 the previous year. This fall highlights the challenges A2M is currently facing in terms of profitability and operating efficiency in the competitive dairy market.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>A2M's ROE is reported at 10%, indicating a decrease from last year’s 13%. This decline reflects the reduced profitability over the year, although still represents a reasonable return for shareholders amid challenging market conditions.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
