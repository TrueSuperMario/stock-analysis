    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>The A2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M) has reported a 4% year-on-year increase in revenue, driven primarily by a rebound in demand for its A2 protein products post-COVID and an expanding presence in international markets, particularly in China.
