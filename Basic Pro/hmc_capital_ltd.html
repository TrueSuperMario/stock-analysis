</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>HMC Capital Ltd has demonstrated a robust revenue growth of 12% year-on-year, driven by an increase in assets under management (AUM) and successful fundraising initiatives. However, earnings growth has lagged slightly at 7%, indicating some pressure on profit margins due to rising operational costs, particularly in fund management and marketing expenses.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company's net profit margin is currently at 8%, a slight contraction from the previous year’s 9%. This decline is attributed to the increased competition in the asset management space and the associated costs of acquiring and retaining clients.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>HMC’s EPS stands at $0.85, reflecting a 5% increase from the previous year. While this growth outpaces the earnings growth percentage, it remains below expectations, hinting at operational inefficiencies.</p>
