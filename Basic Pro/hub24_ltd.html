    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>HUB24 Ltd has reported a robust year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 13%, reaching $242 million for the latest fiscal year.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company’s net profit margin currently stands at 12%, which is reasonable for a fintech firm in the wealth management sector.
