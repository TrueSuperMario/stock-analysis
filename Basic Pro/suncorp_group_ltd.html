</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p>As of September 20, 2024, Suncorp Group Ltd (ASX: SUN) is experiencing a mix of strong operational metrics and external challenges typical for the financial and insurance sectors. The company's latest quarterly earnings report revealed a revenue growth of 8% year-over-year, driven largely by a robust performance in its insurance and banking divisions. However, concerns over rising claims costs and competitive pressure within the banking sector have tempered enthusiasm among investors.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<p>- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Suncorp's P/E ratio is currently around 15, which is slightly below the industry average of 17. This suggests that the stock may be undervalued relative to its peers.</p>
<p>- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: The P/B ratio stands at 1.2, indicating a valuation that reflects the company's solid asset base.</p>
<p>- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Suncorp’s ROE is approximately 10%, consistent with its historical performance but lower than some competitors, reflecting efficient use of shareholders' equity.</p>
<p>- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.4, suggesting that it is conservatively financed and has room to leverage if needed.</p>

    <h3>Analyst Recommendations</h3>

The average target price among analysts is approximately AUD 14.00, representing an upside potential of about 10% from current levels.</p>

    <h3>Insider Activity</h3>
<p>Recent insider trading activity shows minimal buying or selling among Suncorp's executives. This lack of significant insider transactions may suggest that management is confident in the company's current strategy and outlook.

    <h3>Dividend Analysis</h3>
<p>Suncorp has a well-established dividend policy, and as of September 2024, it has declared an interim dividend of AUD 0.26 per share, resulting in a forward dividend yield of around 4.5%.

The dividend payout ratio is approximately 65%, which is sustainable.</p>

    <h3>Market and Sector Conditions</h3>
