<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q1 FY2024, Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd (HVN) reported a revenue decline of approximately 8% compared to the previous corresponding period. This decline is largely attributed to slower retail sales and a challenging consumer spending environment.
