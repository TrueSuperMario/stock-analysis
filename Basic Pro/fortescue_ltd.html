<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) has reported a notable drop in revenue due to lower iron ore prices, with a decrease of approximately 20% year-on-year. This decline has significantly impacted earnings, with net profit down by about 30% compared to the previous year. The revenue challenges stem from fluctuating global demand and increased competition from lower-cost producers.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The current net profit margin stands at around 22%, which, although lower than the previous year’s 28%, is still considered robust for the mining sector.
