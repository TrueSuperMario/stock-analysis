</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>As of the latest financial reports, BHP Group Ltd has posted a revenue of approximately $65 billion for the fiscal year, marking a slight decrease from the previous year due to fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly iron ore and copper, which have faced headwinds from reduced demand in key markets such as China. Earnings have similarly shown a decline, with net profit hovering around $10 billion.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>BHP's net profit margin is currently around 15%, which, while lower than historical averages, is considered stable given the current volatility in global commodity markets. The company's focus on operational efficiency has helped mitigate the impact of rising costs.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The EPS stands at $4.15, which reflects a year-over-year decrease of about 5%. This decline in EPS can mainly be attributed to reduced sales volumes and pricing pressures in key commodities.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>BHP exhibits an impressive ROE of 22%, indicating effective management of equity and robust profit generation. This level of ROE is a testament to BHP's operational efficiency and strong asset management in a challenging market.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>

<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to the industry average:</strong>
<p></p>
