</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of November 2024, Chorus Ltd (CNU) has reported a 3% increase in revenue year-on-year, attributed to the ongoing demand for broadband and network services amid a growing shift towards remote work and digital services. Earnings growth has been slower at around 1%, primarily due to increasing competition in the telecommunications sector and escalating operational costs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>Chorus has a net profit margin of approximately 9%. This figure is somewhat constrained due to the high costs associated with network maintenance and upgrading infrastructure to meet the growing demand for high-speed internet. Despite these pressures, Chorus's efforts to streamline operations are helping to maintain profitability.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The company's EPS stands at $0.60, reflecting a slight decrease from the prior year. This dip is largely due to increased expenses and competitive pricing pressures in the telecommunications market, which have put a strain on profitability.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>Chorus's ROE is currently at 10%, indicative of its effective use of shareholder equity to generate profits. This level is considered reasonable within the telecommunications sector, where capital expenditures are significant.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>Chorus is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 18, which suggests it is moderately valued relative to its earnings capabilities. This valuation reflects market expectations of steady revenue from established services despite rising competitive pressures.</p>
<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to Industry Average:</strong>
<p>The P/E ratio of 18 is slightly higher than the telecommunications industry average of around 16. This premium is likely due to investors' confidence in Chorus's infrastructure and market positioning as a key provider in New Zealand.</p>

    <h3>Analyst Recommendations</h3>
