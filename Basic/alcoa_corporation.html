    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Alcoa Corporation (AAI) reported revenue of $12 billion for the last fiscal year, a decline of 8% year-on-year primarily due to lower aluminum prices and reduced demand in key markets.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
