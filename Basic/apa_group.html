<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>APA Group has reported a revenue increase of 4% year-on-year, driven by a rise in transportation and storage services due to increased demand for natural gas. However, earnings growth has been modest at around 2%, impacted by higher operational expenses and regulatory compliance costs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
