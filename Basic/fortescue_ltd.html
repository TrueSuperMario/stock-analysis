    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) reported a revenue of AUD 14.67 billion for the last fiscal year, down from AUD 21.75 billion the previous year, primarily due to lower iron ore prices. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also declined significantly, reflecting the impact of price fluctuations in the iron ore market alongside increased operational costs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company’s net profit margin has decreased to approximately 20%, a significant drop from previous levels, which were closer to 30%. This decline can be attributed to the drop in iron ore prices and increased costs associated with mining operations and logistics.</p>
