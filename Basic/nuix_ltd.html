<p>NUIX Ltd has shown fluctuating revenue growth trends over the past year, with a reported increase of 8% year-on-year in Q3 FY2025, attributed to stronger demand for its data analytics and e-discovery solutions.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

Despite higher revenues, increased expense ratios related to R&D and marketing have slightly hampered profitability, suggesting a need for improved operational efficiency.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
