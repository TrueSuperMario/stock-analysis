</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>BHP Group Ltd has reported a revenue of $43 billion for the fiscal year ending 2024, reflecting a modest 3% increase year-on-year. This growth is primarily driven by higher commodity prices, particularly in iron ore and copper, in response to robust demand from China. However, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew by only 2%, impacted by rising operational costs and supply chain challenges.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's net profit margin is currently at 20%, a slight decline from the previous year's margin of 22%. While the margins remain strong, they have been compressed due to rising costs associated with energy and labour, and disruptions in logistics.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>BHP's EPS for the latest fiscal year stands at $4.50, a 5% increase from the previous year. This increase reflects the company's ability to maintain profitability despite external pressures, showcasing operational efficiency in its mining operations.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>The current ROE for BHP is 16%, indicating effective utilization of equity to generate returns. Although this is a healthy figure, it represents a decrease from 18% a year prior, partly due to increased levels of working capital and investments in capital projects.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>BHP’s current P/E ratio is 12, which is significantly lower than the industry average of approximately 15. This suggests that BHP may be undervalued relative to its peers, likely as a result of cyclical uncertainties in the commodity markets.</p>
<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to the Industry Average:</strong>
<p>The lower P/E ratio compared to the sector indicates a possible entry point for investors, especially given the cyclical nature of the mining industry and the potential for a rebound in commodity prices.</p>
