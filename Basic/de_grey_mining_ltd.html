<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>De Grey Mining Ltd (DEG) has recently reported a revenue growth of approximately 15% year-on-year, driven primarily by advancements in its exploration activities and prospects in its Mallina Gold Project. The company's earnings, however, fluctuated due to increased exploration expenses and development costs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The net profit margin for De Grey remains low, standing at around -5%. This negative margin reflects the costs associated with exploration and development projects, which are typical for companies in the mining sector, especially those in the early stages of production.</p>
