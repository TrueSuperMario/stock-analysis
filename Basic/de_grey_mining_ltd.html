</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>De Grey Mining Ltd has reported a significant revenue increase of 25% year-on-year, primarily driven by rising gold prices and successful exploration results from their flagship project, the Hemi Gold Project in Western Australia. However, earnings growth has been more modest, with a reported net loss of $2 million due to ongoing exploration and development expenses.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's gross profit margin currently stands at 30%, reflecting effective cost management in exploration and a favorable pricing environment in the gold market. Nevertheless, as a junior mining company in the exploration phase, overall profitability remains under pressure from elevated operational costs.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>As of the last reporting period, EPS is at -$0.02, indicating that while revenue is on the rise, the high cost of exploration and development activities has led to continued losses per share.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>With the company still in a developmental and exploration stage, ROE is currently undefined due to negative earnings. This is typical for companies in the early stages of mining operations.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
