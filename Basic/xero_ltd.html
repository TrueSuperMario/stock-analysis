</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Xero Ltd has seen a robust revenue growth of approximately 15% year-on-year, fueled by the continued demand for cloud-based accounting software, particularly from small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs).
