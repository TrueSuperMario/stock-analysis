    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>The Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (NDQ) has shown significant performance in the current year, with year-to-date returns exceeding 30%. This strong performance is primarily driven by the resurgence of technology stocks following previous downturns, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and e-commerce.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>Since NDQ comprises shares of the Nasdaq 100 Index, it does not have a standalone EPS figure. Instead, the performance is reflected through the growth of its underlying stocks, many of which are enjoying robust earnings growth, reflecting the trend in the tech sector.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>Like EPS, NDQ does not report a distinct ROE. However, investor confidence in its underlying assets, which possess high ROE ratios due to their strong profit generation capabilities, suggests a positive outlook.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>NDQ's weighted average P/E ratio is approximately 25, which indicates a premium valuation compared to the broader market. This reflects the high growth expectations from the technology sector that comprises the ETF.</p>
<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to the industry average:</strong>
<p>The P/E ratio of NDQ is higher than the S&P 500 average of around 20, demonstrating investor confidence in tech stocks' long-term growth potential. This premium valuation is common in sectors perceived to have high future earnings growth.</p>
