    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Homeco Daily Needs REIT (HDN) has demonstrated steady revenue growth, with a year-on-year increase of approximately 6%. This growth has been bolstered by strategic acquisitions and the expansion of its property portfolio targeted towards essential services, ensuring resilience against market volatility.
