</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Betashares Australian High Interest Cash ETF (AAA) has experienced a 4% year-on-year growth in net asset value (NAV), driven primarily by rising interest rates and increased cash inflow from investors seeking lower-risk options. This growth in NAV reflects the broader trend of heightened interest from retail and institutional investors aiming to safeguard capital amidst volatile equity markets.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>EPS for AAA is not conventional for an ETF focusing on cash assets. Instead, the emphasis is on yield, with the current effective cash yield at around 4.5%, reflecting the higher interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).</p>
