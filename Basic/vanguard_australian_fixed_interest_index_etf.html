</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>The Vanguard Australian Fixed Interest INDEX ETF (VAF) has reported a moderate year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 3%. This growth is largely attributed to the stable performance of the underlying Australian fixed interest market, which has been buoyed by low interest rates and ongoing demand for government bonds.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>As an ETF, VAF does not have profit margins in the traditional sense; however, its expense ratio stands at a low 0.20%. This operational efficiency helps maximize shareholder returns, particularly in the context of the low yield environment that characterizes fixed interest investments.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>Although EPS metrics are not frequently reported for ETFs, VAF maintains a consistent distribution of income derived from its underlying assets, providing returns to investors without the direct reporting of EPS.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>ROE is not applicable in the traditional sense since it operates as an index fund, but the efficiency of VAF in tracking the Australian fixed interest index reflects a commitment to a low-cost investment strategy which effectively works for long-term investor outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>VAF does not have an explicit P/E ratio as it is based on fixed interest securities. However, it tracks the performance of the Australian fixed interest market, which has historically provided lower returns compared to equities, making such metrics less relevant.</p>
