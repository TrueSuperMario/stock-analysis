    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of late December 2024, the iShares Core Composite Bond ETF (IAF) has seen a modest revenue growth of approximately 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by increasing interest in fixed-income investments in a volatile economic environment.
