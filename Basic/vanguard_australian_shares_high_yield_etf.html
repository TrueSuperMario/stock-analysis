</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of January 6, 2025, the Vanguard Australian Shares High Yield ETF (VHY) has demonstrated a robust revenue growth trajectory, driven primarily by its focus on high-yielding Australian equities. The ETF has achieved a year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 8%, with earnings growth slightly less at 6%. This reflects an overall positive sentiment in the Australian equity market, coupled with strong performances from top holdings in sectors such as financial services and materials.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>VHY, being an equity fund, does not have traditional profit margins like a corporate entity. However, the fund's expense ratio is around 0.25%, which is considered competitive in the ETF space. This suggests that the fund efficiently manages its operational costs while delivering value to investors.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The concept of EPS is not directly applicable to VHY as it is a fund, but the ETF has had a steady growth in its distributions, reflecting underlying earnings from its portfolio holdings. Its cumulative distributions in the last 12 months have shown an increase consistent with the growth of the underlying assets.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>As an ETF, VHY does not have an ROE as it is not a corporate entity but rather a portfolio of equities. Nonetheless, the underlying companies within the ETF are generally performing well, contributing to the fund's attractive yield and performance metrics.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>VHY currently has a trailing P/E ratio of about 15. This valuation indicates that the ETF is relatively attractively priced compared to the broader Australian stock market, which has an average P/E ratio of approximately 18. This suggests potential for capital appreciation.</p>
<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to the industry average:</strong>
<p>The P/E ratio of VHY is notably lower than the S&P/ASX 200 index average, indicating that the ETF may offer good value relative to its growth prospects. This is particularly appealing in a high-yield context as it provides an opportunity for both income and growth.</p>
