</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of December 30, 2024, the Vanguard Australian Shares INDEX ETF (VAS) has shown a positive revenue growth trajectory, driven primarily by an uptick in equity market performance in the Australian landscape. Year-to-date returns for VAS have been around 9%, thanks to a resurgence in the performance of large-cap Australian companies and a recovery in commodities, which play a significant role in the Australian economy.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>While ETFs do not have profit margins per se, the net asset value (NAV) growth reflects operational efficiency. VAS has maintained a low expense ratio of around 0.10%, which optimally manages the costs associated with fund operations. This efficiency contributes positively to investor returns as the fund tracks the S&P/ASX 300 Index effectively.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>EPS is not directly applicable to ETFs like VAS; however, the increase in NAV signifies effective asset management and growth across the underlying portfolio. Since VAS is a passively managed fund, its financial performance closely follows that of its indexed holdings.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>Similar to EPS, ROE is not a conventional metric for ETF performance. However, VAS's ROE essentially reflects the performance of its underlying assets, which are primarily robust Australian companies with stable earnings.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
