    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>AGL Energy Ltd reported a revenue growth of 4% year-on-year, primarily fueled by the increase in electricity prices due to the rising demand for energy and adjustments in the energy market. Earnings growth, however, was flat due to escalating operational costs and maintenance expenses in their infrastructure.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
