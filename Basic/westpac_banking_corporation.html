    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q3 2024, Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC) has shown a year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 4%. This growth is driven by an increase in lending volumes and improved fees from transactions. However, earnings growth has been impacted by rising operating expenses and provisions for credit losses, resulting in a modest increase in net profit of around 2%.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
