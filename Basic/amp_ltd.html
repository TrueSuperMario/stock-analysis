<h3>Current Performance</h3>
<li>**Revenue and Earnings Growth:**</li>
<p>AMP Ltd (AMP) has shown a moderate increase in revenue, growing by 1.5% year-over-year.

Net earnings, however, have declined slightly by 0.5%, reflecting ongoing restructuring costs and lower investment income.</p>
<li>**Profit Margins:**</li>
