Earnings have also seen growth, albeit at a slower pace of around 2%, influenced by higher operating costs and market volatility affecting investment performance.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's net profit margin stands at 8%, suggesting a stable profitability level despite the challenges it faced in operational efficiency. The margin reflects ongoing cost-control efforts, though the pressure from competitive pricing and market fluctuations is evident.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
