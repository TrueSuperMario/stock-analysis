    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Auckland International Airport Ltd (AIA) has shown strong recovery following the pandemic, with total operating revenue for the year increasing by 15% compared to the previous year.

<p>AIA's net profit margin currently stands at 20%, which is healthy given the competitive nature of the aviation industry. The margin has been affected by increased inflation and operational costs, but the return of passenger traffic has helped maintain a positive outlook.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The EPS has risen to NZ$0.45, reflecting a steady recovery in profitability compared to NZ$0.42 in the previous year. This represents a 7% growth year-on-year, driven by higher passenger volumes and increased retail sales at the airport.</p>
