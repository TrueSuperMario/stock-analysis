</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p>Revenue and Earnings Growth:</p>
<p>Pexa Group Ltd (PXA) has shown notable year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 12%, driven largely by increased transaction volumes in property settlements amid a recovering Australian real estate market. However, earnings growth has lagged at about 6%, reflecting higher costs associated with technological upgrades and market expansion initiatives.</p>
<p>Profit Margins:</p>
<p>The company's net profit margin stands at around 15%, which is respectable for a company in the fintech and digital property settlement space. Margins are under pressure from competitive pricing but have shown resilience due to cost containment efforts and improved operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
