</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>The Vanguard Australian Shares INDEX ETF (VAS) has recorded a year-to-date performance increase of approximately 7%, buoyed by the overall resilience of the Australian equity market post-pandemic. The ETF tracks the S&P/ASX 300 Index and has benefitted from a strong recovery in various sectors, particularly financials and materials.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>As an index fund, VAS does not directly report profit margins as a traditional company would. However, it benefits from lower management fees, typically around 0.10%, which ensures that a higher proportion of investment performance is returned to the investors.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>EPS statistics are not directly applicable to ETFs like VAS, as they are based on the aggregate earnings of the underlying portfolio of Australian companies. However, the ETF has shown consistent tracking of the index, reflecting overall market performance.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>Since VAS is an ETF rather than a corporate entity, it does not have a ROE figure. However, it's worth noting that the aggregate ROE of the companies within the index can often exceed 12%, reflecting strong profitability and efficient use of equity among the underlying constituents.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>- - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
