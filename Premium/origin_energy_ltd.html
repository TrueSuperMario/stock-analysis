</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of the latest financial disclosures, Origin Energy Ltd (ORG) has reported a revenue growth of 8% year-on-year, driven by an increase in natural gas demand and the integration of renewable energy sources. However, net earnings have experienced a decline of 4%, largely due to increased operational costs and investments in infrastructure.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>ORG's net profit margin currently stands at 7%, showing a slight contraction compared to the previous year.

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The EPS for ORG is at $0.90, marking a decrease of 3% from last year. This decline reflects the impact of higher costs and investments in growth areas, particularly in renewable projects that have yet to yield substantial returns.</p>
