</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Origin Energy Ltd (ORG) has shown a robust financial performance over the past year, with revenue increasing by 12% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher energy prices and strong demand across its integrated energy operations. However, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) growth has only improved by 2%, reflecting increased operational costs and regulatory pressures in the energy sector.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's net profit margin stands at 8%, which, while lower than some competitors, indicates a stable performance in a challenging market environment. The pressures from fluctuating fuel prices and increased operational expenses slightly impact these margins.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The current EPS for ORG is reported at $1.05, a reduction of 5% compared to the previous year, influenced by increased costs and lower processing margins in its gas operations. While this decline is concerning, the company has been investing in new projects which may improve future earnings.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>ORG's ROE is currently at 10%, which is reasonable for a utility company but suggests there is room for improvement, especially in maximising returns on shareholder equity amidst competitive pressures.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
