    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Fletcher Building Ltd (FBU) has reported a revenue growth of 8% year-on-year, attributed primarily to increased demand for residential and commercial construction materials. However, earnings growth has only been 2%, hindered by rising raw material costs and supply chain challenges.</p>
