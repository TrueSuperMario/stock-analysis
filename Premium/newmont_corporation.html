<p>Newmont Corporation (NEM) reported revenue of $3.5 billion in Q2 2024, reflecting a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Increased production from new mines and robust gold prices have contributed positively. However, earnings have grown at a slower rate of 4% year-on-year, as rising operational costs amid inflationary pressures have slightly dampened profitability.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company's gross profit margin stands at 45%, which is on par with industry standards, showcasing its ability to maintain profitability despite cost inflation.
