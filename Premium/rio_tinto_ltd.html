</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>RIO Tinto Ltd has reported a revenue decline of approximately 10% year-on-year, primarily due to lower commodity prices, particularly for iron ore and copper. Earnings have been more adversely affected, decreasing by about 15%, reflecting higher production costs and operational challenges in various mines.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company’s net profit margin has contracted to around 20%, which, although significant, indicates challenges in maintaining profitability amid declining prices. Increased operational costs due to inflation and supply chain disruptions have further pressured margins.</p>
