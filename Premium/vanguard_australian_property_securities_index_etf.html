    <h3>Current Performance</h3>

<p>The Vanguard Australian Property Securities INDEX ETF (VAP) has shown a 4% increase in revenue year-on-year, primarily supported by a recovery in the Australian property market post-pandemic. However, earnings growth is more subdued at 1.5%, attributed to rising interest rates and inflationary pressures that have led to higher costs for property operations and management.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The net profit margin of VAP is currently at 8%, indicative of a challenging environment for property managers due to increased competition and cost pressures.

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The ETF has reported an EPS of $0.95, reflecting a modest increase of 2% over the past year. This is consistent with the performance of the underlying properties in the index, but overall growth remains limited by external economic factors impacting the sector.</p>
