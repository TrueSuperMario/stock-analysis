<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of September 2024, Xero Ltd (XRO) has reported a significant revenue increase of 12% year-on-year, largely driven by a rise in customer subscriptions and expansion into new markets. However, its earnings growth has been more modest at 5%, partly due to increased investment in product development and marketing to sustain growth momentum.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>Xero’s net profit margin currently stands at 8%, which is reasonable for a tech company in the SaaS (Software as a Service) space. The margin reflects ongoing investments in scale and customer acquisition, but an increase in operational costs has slightly pressured profitability.</p>
