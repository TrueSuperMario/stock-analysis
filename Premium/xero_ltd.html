<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Xero Ltd has reported a revenue increase of 24% year-on-year, driven by strong user acquisition and expansion into new markets, particularly in North America and the United Kingdom. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth has also shown robust performance, indicating solid operational leverage as customer numbers rise.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's gross profit margin stands at approximately 85%, which reflects its SaaS business model's efficiency. However, net profit remains in the negative due to ongoing investments in growth and customer acquisition, which are typical for high-growth tech firms.</p>

<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
