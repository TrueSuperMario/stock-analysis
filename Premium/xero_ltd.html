</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Xero Ltd (XRO) has demonstrated a robust year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 24%, driven by increasing demand for its cloud-based accounting software among small and medium-sized enterprises. This continues the momentum from previous years, showcasing Xero's strong market position. However, net earnings have seen a smaller growth of around 12%, primarily due to increased investments in international expansion and marketing.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company’s operating profit margin stands at 15%, reflecting an improvement due to operational efficiencies and scale benefits from its growing subscriber base. Despite this, elevated expenditure on customer acquisition and product innovation has put pressure on net profit margins, which sit at about 8%.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Xero reports an EPS of AUD 0.38, marking a 10% increase from the previous year. This modest uptick is aligned with the company's strategic focus on expanding its user base and enhancing product offerings rather than immediate profitability.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>

<p>Xero’s ROE is currently at 9%, which, while respectable for a tech company, indicates that there is still room for improvement. The relatively lower ROE can be attributed to the substantial reinvestments in growth.</p>
