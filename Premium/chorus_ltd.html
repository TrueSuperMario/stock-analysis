</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Chorus Ltd (CNU) has reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 3%, primarily due to an increase in demand for broadband services and higher contributions from its fibre network. However, earnings growth has been slower at around 1%, impacted by rising operational costs and ongoing investment in network expansion.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company currently maintains a net profit margin of 15%. This margin reflects the competitive pricing in the telecommunications sector and the high capital expenditure associated with maintaining and upgrading the network infrastructure.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>As of the latest reporting period, CNU’s EPS stands at $0.63, which represents a decrease of 2% compared to the previous year. This decline is attributed to increased depreciation expenses related to the fibre rollout and competitive pressures impacting pricing.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
