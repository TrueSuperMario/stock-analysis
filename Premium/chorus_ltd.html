<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> Chorus Ltd (CNU) has shown a 3% year-on-year revenue growth, attributed to increasing demand for digital connectivity and the rollout of its fiber network. However, earnings growth has been modest at 1%, as operational costs have edged higher due to ongoing investments in infrastructure.</p>
