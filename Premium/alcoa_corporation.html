</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> Alcoa Corporation (AAI) has reported a year-on-year revenue decline of approximately 10%, primarily driven by lower aluminum prices and demand fluctuations. Earnings, on the other hand, experienced a more pronounced drop of around 25%, reflecting the impact of inflationary pressures and rising operational costs in the wake of global economic uncertainties.</p>
<p><strong>- Profit Margins:</strong> The company’s net profit margin is currently at 5%, which indicates a tightening of margins due to increased input costs and fluctuations in aluminum pricing.
