<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>- As of October 2024, Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:</strong>
<p>AA) has observed a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 8%, primarily attributed to decreased aluminum prices and lower global demand in various sectors, including automotive and construction. Earnings have also dropped significantly, with a reported loss in the most recent quarter largely driven by rising energy costs and operational challenges in key markets.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<p>The company has faced pressures on its profit margins, with net profit margins currently sitting at around -3%. This negative margin reflects substantial cost challenges, including escalating raw material prices and declining product sales, further compounded by global economic uncertainties.</p>
