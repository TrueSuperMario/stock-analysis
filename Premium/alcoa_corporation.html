    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Alcoa Corporation (AAI) reported revenues of approximately $11.6 billion in the last fiscal year, experiencing a modest year-on-year growth of about 2%. The slight increase in revenue can be attributed to a rebound in demand for aluminum from key industries, including aerospace and automotive, as well as higher pricing on global markets. However, net income saw a more significant decline of around 15% to $675 million, reflecting increased production costs and supply chain challenges.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Alcoa's net profit margin has decreased to approximately 5.8% due to heightened costs related to raw materials and energy, alongside disruptions in supply chains causing operational inefficiencies. This reduction in margin highlights the ongoing challenges faced by aluminum producers in a volatile cost environment.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>EPS is currently reported at $4.40, which is a decrease of about 20% from the previous year. The decline reflects the impact of lower profit margins and increased operational costs, despite stable revenue generation.</p>
