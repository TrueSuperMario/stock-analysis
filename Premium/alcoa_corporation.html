    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q3 2024, Alcoa Corporation reported a revenue of $2.35 billion, a decrease of approximately 10% year-on-year. This decline is primarily attributed to fluctuating aluminum prices and reduced demand in key markets. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) fell to $385 million, reflecting a strategic focus on cost management amid challenging market conditions.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>Alcoa's profit margin has contracted to 9%, down from 12% in the prior year. This drop is linked to increased production costs and lower aluminum prices, which have pressured profitability despite operational efficiencies.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The current EPS stands at $0.92, marking a decrease of 15% year-on-year. The decline in EPS is a result of both decreased revenues and higher input costs, impacting the bottom line significantly.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>The company’s ROE is calculated at 7%, indicating a moderate ability to generate profits from shareholders' equity. While this is impacted by a current decline in profitability, Alcoa’s historical focus on capital efficiency remains.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>

<strong>-  P/E Ratio Compared to Industry Average:</strong>
