    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> Mercury NZ Ltd (MCY) reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 6%, attributed to rising electricity demand amidst New Zealand's ongoing shift towards renewable energy sources. Earnings grew by 4%, partly due to increased operational efficiencies, although rising costs in energy production and network maintenance have started to put pressure on profit margins.</p>
<p><strong>- Profit Margins:</strong> The company's net profit margin currently stands at 9%, reflecting a slight contraction due to higher operational costs and investments in renewables. Despite these challenges, Mercury maintains a competitive edge through its diversified energy generation mix, primarily consisting of hydroelectric, geothermal, and wind power.</p>
