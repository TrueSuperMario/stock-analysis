    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Transurban Group (TCL) has reported a solid revenue growth trajectory, with an increase of approximately 8% year-on-year. This growth is largely driven by an increase in toll revenues due to higher traffic volumes across its networks, reflecting a post-pandemic return to steady commuting patterns. However, net earnings growth has been more modest at around 4%, impacted by rising operational costs and ongoing maintenance expenses.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
