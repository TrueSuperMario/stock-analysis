</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of November 2024, Viva Energy Group Ltd (VEA) reported a revenue of AUD 9.3 billion for the fiscal year, marking a 7% increase compared to the previous year. This growth is driven by higher fuel demand post-COVID-19 recovery and increased sales volume in the retail segment. However, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew at a slower pace (3%) due to rising operational costs and competitive pricing pressures.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>VEA’s net profit margin is currently around 4.5%. While this represents a slight decrease from 5% in the prior year, it remains reasonable given the fluctuating oil prices and increased costs associated with logistics and distribution.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The company's EPS stands at AUD 0.60, reflecting a modest decline of 1.5% year-on-year. This slight drop can be attributed to increasing operational costs offsetting revenue growth, underscoring the challenges within the current market environment.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>Viva Energy's ROE is reported at 9%, indicating an effective use of shareholder equity to generate profits. While this value is solid for a company in the energy sector, it does highlight the necessity for continued operational efficiency improvements.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>VEA’s current P/E ratio is approximately 14, suggesting that the stock is relatively valued compared to its historical averages. This valuation is reflective of the company’s stable cash flows, but it also signals some caution among investors regarding growth prospects.</p>
<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to the industry average:</strong>

    <h3>Analyst Recommendations</h3>

<strong>-  Price Targets:</strong>
<p>The average analyst price target for VEA is AUD 9.00, with estimates ranging from AUD 8.50 to AUD 9.50. This implies limited upside potential from current trading levels, aligning with the measured growth expectations noted in analyst reports.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Viva Energy Group Ltd is navigating a challenging yet improving energy landscape marked by post-pandemic recovery and rising fuel demand. While the company demonstrates solid revenue growth and maintains a healthy dividend, its profitability faces pressures from rising costs and competitive dynamics.
