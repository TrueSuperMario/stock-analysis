</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC) reported a revenue growth of 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by increased lending activity and a solid performance in its wealth management division. However, earnings growth was slightly muted at 1%, as the bank faced higher operational costs and increased provisions for loan losses, reflecting a cautious economic outlook.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The bank maintains a net profit margin of 22%, which is reasonably healthy given the competitive nature of the banking sector in Australia and New Zealand. Margins are being pressured by rising interest rates and the associated cost of funding.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>EPS for WBC stands at $1.50, representing a 1.5% increase from the previous year. This modest growth indicates WBC's ability to navigate a challenging economic landscape while remaining profitable.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>The bank's ROE is approximately 10%, reflecting a solid return for shareholders and efficient use of equity, though lower than some of its competitors, indicating room for improvement in capital efficiency.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
