</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> As of September 2024, Westgold Resources Ltd (WGX) has experienced significant revenue growth year-on-year, attributed largely to increased production levels from its various mining operations in the Murchison region of Western Australia.
