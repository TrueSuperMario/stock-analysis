<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Argo Investments Ltd (ARG) has reported a decrease in revenue by 4% year-on-year, primarily due to fluctuating market conditions and a decline in the performance of growth-oriented investments. Earnings per share (EPS) have similarly declined by approximately 6%, reflecting challenges in maintaining profitability amid changing investment landscapes.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<p>The company's net profit margin currently stands at 12%, which is relatively stable yet shows signs of pressure from higher operational costs and expenses associated with investment management. This margin is considered decent given the current volatility in market conditions.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
