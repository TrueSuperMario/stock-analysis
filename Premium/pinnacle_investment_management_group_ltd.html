<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> Pinnacle Investment Management Group Ltd (PNI) has reported revenue growth of approximately 8% year-on-year, driven by an increase in funds under management (FUM) and strong inflows into its diversified investment products. Earnings growth has been slightly more modest at around 5%, reflecting competitive pressures and a high-cost environment in the financial services industry.</p>
