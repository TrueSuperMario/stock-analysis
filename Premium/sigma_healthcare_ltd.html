    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Sigma Healthcare Ltd (SIG) reported a revenue decline of 2% year-on-year, largely attributed to increased competition and pricing pressures in the pharmaceutical distribution sector.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
