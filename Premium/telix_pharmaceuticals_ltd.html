</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>TELIX Pharmaceuticals Ltd (TLX) has reported robust revenue growth, with a year-on-year increase of 40%, primarily driven by strong demand for its prostate cancer therapies and the successful launch of its new products.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company’s gross profit margin stands at approximately 60%, indicative of its ability to maintain high prices for its innovative products.
