    <title>Dimensional Global Core Equity Trust Unhedged - Active ETF (DGCE) Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> Dimensional Global Core Equity Trust Unhedged - Active ETF (DGCE) has shown a year-to-date performance return of approximately 10%. This growth is attributed to a diversified investment strategy that captures broad equity exposure across multiple sectors and regions, allowing it to benefit from recovering global markets post-pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>- Profit Margins:</strong> As an ETF, DGCE does not directly express profit margins as a traditional corporation would, but its expense ratio is around 0.23%, which is relatively low for active funds. This translates into better net performance for investors compared to higher-fee counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>- Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong> Since ETFs traditionally don't report EPS like individual stocks, DGCE's results are reflected in its net asset value (NAV), which has increased consistently, indicating solid underlying performance of the equities held in the portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>- Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> ROE is not a relevant measure for an ETF as it is not a company but rather a diversified investment vehicle. However, the ETF's performance reflects the overall returns of its holdings, which have a history of solid returns across various market conditions.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<p><strong>- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong> DGCE's underlying equities have a weighted average P/E ratio of approximately 18, which is in line with the broader market average, indicating it is fairly valued compared to historical performance and growth expectations.</p>
<p><strong>- P/E Ratio compared to the industry average:</strong> The P/E ratio of 18 marginally exceeds the average for global equity ETFs, which stands at 17. This premium may be justified by the active management strategy employed by Dimensional, which historically yields above-average returns.</p>

<p><strong>- Consensus Rating:</strong> The consensus among analysts for DGCE leans towards a 'Buy' rating, driven by its strong performance, well-diversified portfolio, and active management strategies that aim to capitalize on market inefficiencies.</p>
