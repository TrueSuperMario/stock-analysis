    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Treasury Wine Estates Ltd (TWE) reported revenue growth of 6% year-on-year, fueled by strong demand in both the United States and Asia-Pacific markets.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company's EPS stands at $0.55, a slight increase of 1.5% from the previous year. This subdued growth is indicative of the ongoing challenges in the global market as TWE adapts to shifting consumer preferences and supply chain issues.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
