    <title>Vanguard MSCI INDEX International Shares ETF (VGS) Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF (VGS) has exhibited a solid recovery over the past year, with revenue growth driven by an increase in global stock market valuations and capital inflows into international equities. The ETF's performance reflects a year-to-date return of approximately 15%, showcasing resilience in a challenging global economic environment.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>As an index-tracking ETF, VGS does not directly report profit margins in the traditional corporate sense. However, the fund’s operating expenses are low, typically around 0.18%, reflecting efficient management and cost control, which allows the bulk of investor capital to be allocated to the underlying equity holdings.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>With ETFs, EPS isn’t calculated in the same way as for individual stocks. Instead, VGS tracks the performance of its underlying holdings. Shareholders benefit from capital appreciation and dividends from the underlying stocks, rather than traditional EPS growth.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>VGS does not have a return on equity metric since it is not a corporation; instead, it holds a diversified portfolio of international equities which collectively provide market returns. The effectiveness of the fund can be gauged through its tracking error relative to the MSCI benchmark.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The P/E ratio of the underlying companies in the ETF averages around 18, suggesting that the market values these international equities with moderate optimism relative to their earnings potential, with a slight premium compared to historical averages.</p>
<strong>-  P/E Ratio compared to Industry Average:</strong>
<p></p>

    <h3>Analyst Recommendations</h3>

    <h3>Insider Activity</h3>
