    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q3 2024, New Hope Corporation Ltd (NHC) reports a revenue growth rate of 12% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher coal prices and increased production levels as the global demand for coal continues to rebound post-pandemic.
