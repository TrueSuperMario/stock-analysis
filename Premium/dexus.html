    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q3 2024, Dexus (DXS) has reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 6%, attributed to improved occupancy rates and higher rental yields across its property portfolio. However, earnings growth has been slower at around 2%, mainly due to increased operational costs associated with property management and maintenance.</p>
