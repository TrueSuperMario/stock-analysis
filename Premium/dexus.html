    <ul>
<h3>Current Performance</h3>
<li>**Revenue and Earnings Growth:**</li>
<p>Dexus (DXS) has demonstrated stable revenue growth over the past year, increasing by 4% year-on-year.

Earnings growth, however, has been somewhat muted at 2%, reflecting higher operational costs and increased investment in property upgrades and developments.</p>
<li>**Profit Margins:**</li>

<li>**Earnings Per Share (EPS):**</li>
<p>EPS is currently at $0.95, representing a slight increase of 1.5% from the previous year. This modest growth is indicative of the company’s consistent performance in the commercial real estate market and its capacity to generate stable earnings.</p>
<li>**Return on Equity (ROE):**</li>
<p>Dexus’s ROE is 8%, which is relatively healthy for a real estate investment trust (REIT). This figure indicates effective use of shareholder equity to drive profits, although it reflects the conservative nature of the real estate sector.</p>
