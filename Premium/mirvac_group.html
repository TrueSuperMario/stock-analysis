    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Mirvac Group has reported a revenue increase of approximately 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by strong demand in both residential and commercial property segments. However, earnings growth has lagged behind at around 4%, impacted by rising construction costs and supply chain challenges.</p>
