</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>De Grey Mining Ltd (DEG) reported significant revenue growth of approximately 28% year-on-year, attributable to increased gold production from its flagship Hemi project in Western Australia. The company has shifted focus towards transitioning from exploration to development, which has positively impacted revenue generation. However, net profit growth remains modest at around 5% due to rising operational costs and investment in further exploration.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
