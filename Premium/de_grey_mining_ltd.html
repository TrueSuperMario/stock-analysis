    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>De Grey Mining Ltd (DEG) has reported a robust revenue growth of 15% year-on-year, driven by successful exploration outcomes and strengthened mineral resource estimates. However, earnings growth has been slower at 8%, attributed to rising exploratory and operational costs associated with expanding its projects.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>

<p>De Grey’s current net profit margin is approximately 12%. While this margin reflects a healthy profitability level, increasing costs related to exploration and labor have exerted downward pressure, prompting management to implement cost-control measures.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The EPS stands at $0.15, marking a 5% increase from the previous year, underscoring the company’s ability to generate profits despite headwinds from rising expenditures and exploration costs.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
