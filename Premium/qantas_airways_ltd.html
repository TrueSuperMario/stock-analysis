<p>Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN) reported a significant rebound in its financial performance following the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current fiscal year, Qantas has experienced a revenue increase of 25% year-on-year, driven by a resurgence in travel demand and improvements in international flights. However, the earnings growth has been more modest at 10%, reflecting ongoing operational challenges, including staffing shortages and increased fuel costs.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's net profit margin sits at 8%, which shows improvement as travel demand continues to rise. While Qantas has managed to enhance its profitability compared to the previous year, climbing operational costs have pressured margins slightly.</p>
