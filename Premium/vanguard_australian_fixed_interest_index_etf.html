    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Vanguard Australian Fixed Interest INDEX ETF (VAF) has seen a decline in revenue year-on-year as bond yields have risen, leading to lower fixed interest returns. The ETF reported a decrease in income attributable to higher interest rates which inversely affect bond prices.</p>
