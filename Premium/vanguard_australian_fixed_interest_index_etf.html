<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The Vanguard Australian Fixed Interest INDEX ETF (VAF) has demonstrated stable performance, with year-to-date returns reflecting a modest increase of approximately 3%. This result is largely attributed to the ongoing demand for fixed income investments, particularly in a fluctuating interest rate environment.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>As a passively managed exchange-traded fund that tracks Australian fixed interest securities, VAF does not have traditional profit margins typical of a corporate entity. However, it effectively maintains low expense ratios, which stands at 0.20%, allowing investors to capture most of the returns generated by the underlying bond portfolio.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>While ETFs like VAF do not typically report EPS, they do reflect income generated from interest payments on the underlying investments. VAF has consistently paid out distributions that are indicative of the interest income generated from Australian bonds.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>VAF's structure as an ETF means it does not report ROE in the conventional sense. Instead, performance can be evaluated through its tracking error, which is relatively low at 0.10%, indicating effective tracking of its benchmark index and good utilisation of its investment strategy.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>- - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>

<strong>- - Yield Comparison:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>VAF's yield is competitive compared to other fixed income securities in the Australian market, making it an attractive option for conservative investors seeking income stability.
