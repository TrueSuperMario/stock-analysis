<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>ANZ Group Holdings Ltd has reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 4%, driven primarily by an increase in lending volumes and improved fee income from its retail and commercial banking divisions. However, net profit growth has been more muted at approximately 2%, largely due to elevated provisions for loan losses in response to macroeconomic uncertainties.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company’s net profit margin currently stands at 24%, reflecting strong operational efficiency and cost management initiatives. Although rising interest rates are helping to improve net interest margins, the impact of economic pressures on borrowers has introduced some volatility in expected future profitability.</p>
