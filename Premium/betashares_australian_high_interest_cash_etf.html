<p>As of October 2024, the Betashares Australian High Interest Cash ETF (AAA) has shown a stable performance, with its NAV experiencing a year-to-date increase of approximately 3.5%. This performance is primarily driven by its underlying holdings in high-interest savings accounts and term deposits, which benefit from the current high-interest rate environment in Australia.</p>
<strong>-  Total Return:</strong>
<p>The total return on the ETF, including distributions, stands at around 4.5% year-to-date. This return reflects the positive impact of rising interest rates on the cash and short-term fixed income investments held within the fund.</p>
<strong>-  Expense Ratio:</strong>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:</strong>

<strong>-  Price Targets:</strong>
<p>With a focus on cash holdings, traditional price targets are less applicable; however, analysts suggest that the ETF is well-positioned to maintain its yield and capital stability, which are the primary objectives for investors.</p>

    <h3>Insider Activity</h3>
<strong>-  Recent Transactions:</strong>
<p>There have been no notable insider buying or selling activities reported in the Betashares Australian High Interest Cash ETF, which is typical for ETFS that primarily track cash and cash-equivalent investments. The lack of insider transactions indicates a stable sentiment among fund managers and stakeholders.</p>

    <h3>Market and Sector Conditions</h3>
