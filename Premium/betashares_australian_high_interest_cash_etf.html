<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Betashares Australian High Interest Cash ETF (AAA) has shown consistent revenue generation aligned with the recent trends in cash management, driven by heightened interest rates. The fund has reported an annualized increase in assets, reflecting strong demand for low-risk investment options amid market volatility.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>As a cash management ETF, AAA does not operate with traditional profit margins but rather passes on the interest income directly to investors. Its overall expense ratio is low, allowing a higher percentage of interest income to be distributed.</p>
