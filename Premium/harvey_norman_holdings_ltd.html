</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of Q1 FY2024, Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd has reported a 3% decline in revenue year-on-year, primarily due to decreased consumer spending and the impact of rising interest rates on the housing market. Earnings before tax have also dropped by approximately 5%, reflecting the broader economic challenges facing the retail sector.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company's net profit margin has contracted to around 8%, down from 9% in the previous year. This decline is attributed to increased operational costs and competitive pricing pressures in the retail market, particularly in home appliances and furniture sectors.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>The EPS for HVN has decreased to $0.62, reflecting a decline of about 4% from last year's $0.65. This trend highlights the challenging market conditions and the need for strategic adjustments to drive future earnings.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>HVN's ROE stands at 11%, which is a moderate figure for the retail sector. This indicates a reasonable return on shareholder investments, but the decline over the past year points to challenges in profit generation relative to equity.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>-  Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
