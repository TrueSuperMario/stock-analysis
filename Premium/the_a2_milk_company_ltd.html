    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p>Revenue and Earnings Growth:</p>
<p>The A2 Milk Company Ltd (A2M) has reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 10%, fueled by robust sales in its core infant formula segment and expansion into international markets, particularly in Asia. However, earnings growth has been more subdued, showing a 4% increase, primarily due to rising costs associated with raw materials and logistics.</p>
<p>Profit Margins:</p>
