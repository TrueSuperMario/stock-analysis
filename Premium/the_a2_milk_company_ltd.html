<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>A2 Milk reported a 2% year-on-year revenue growth, resulting in NZD 1.43 billion for the fiscal year 2024. The modest growth is attributed to increased sales in key markets like Australia and China, but challenges remain due to fierce competition and pricing pressures. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) saw a more pronounced decline of approximately 5%, indicating difficulties in maintaining profitability.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company's net profit margin currently stands at 8%, which is under pressure compared to previous years due to higher input costs and increased marketing expenses.

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The EPS is at NZD 0.38, down from NZD 0.40 in the previous year. This slight decrease reflects the challenging market conditions affecting overall profitability and is indicative of the company’s struggle to bolster its bottom line over the past year.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
