<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG) has demonstrated a moderate revenue growth rate of approximately 4% year-on-year, driven by an increase in insurance premium collections across its personal and commercial lines, including growth in motor and property insurance. However, the company has faced challenges with earnings, reporting a slight decline of 2% in net profits largely attributed to higher claims costs stemming from increased natural disaster claims.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>

<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The EPS for IAG stands at $0.48, reflecting a decline from the previous year. This decrease can be traced back to both volatile claims experience and increased operational costs, but the company remains focused on strategic initiatives aimed at bolstering long-term profitability.</p>
