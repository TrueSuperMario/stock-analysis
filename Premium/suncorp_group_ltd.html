<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> Suncorp Group Ltd (SUN) has reported a year-on-year revenue growth of 6% in the latest quarter, driven largely by an increase in premiums across its insurance segments and strong performance in its banking division.
