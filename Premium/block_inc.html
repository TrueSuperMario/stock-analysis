<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Block Inc (SQ2) has reported revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by increased transaction volumes and the expansion of its Cash App ecosystem.

<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company’s gross profit margin stands at 40%, indicating a robust ability to generate profit from its revenue despite rising operational costs. Operating margins have compressed slightly to 15% due to higher expenses related to technology development and customer acquisition.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
