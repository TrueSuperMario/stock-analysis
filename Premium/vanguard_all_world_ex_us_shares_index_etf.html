    <title>Vanguard All-World Ex-US Shares INDEX ETF (VEU) Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>As of September 26, 2024, the Vanguard All-World Ex-US Shares INDEX ETF (VEU) has reported a year-to-date performance reflecting a moderate decline of approximately 2.5%, which is indicative of the volatile conditions in international markets. Despite this, its annualized return over the past three years has been about 8%, buoyed by recovery in developing markets and favorable currency fluctuations.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The ETF's structure as a passively managed fund allows for low expense ratios, with the current total expense ratio at 0.08%. This contributes to efficient fund management but does not directly reflect profit margins, as ETFs do not generate earnings in the same sense that individual companies do.</p>
<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>EPS is not applicable to an ETF like VEU, as it is composed of various international stocks, aggregating their performance rather than generating discrete earnings itself.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p>Similarly, ROE does not apply directly to VEU since it is a fund holding multiple equities rather than a single company.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<strong>- - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong>
<p>The current P/E ratio for VEU stands at approximately 15, which is below the global average P/E of 18. This suggests that the ETF is relatively undervalued compared to global equity markets, offering potentially attractive entry points for long-term investors.</p>
<strong>- - P/E Ratio compared to the industry average:</strong>
<p>When compared to other international ETFs, VEU's P/E ratio is competitive. Many comparable ETFs trading on similar metrics are closer to the 17 P/E range, underscoring VEU's position as offering potential value in the international market segment.</p>

    <h3>Analyst Recommendations</h3>
<strong>- - Consensus Rating:</strong>

<strong>- - Price Targets:</strong>
<p>The average price target for VEU over the next 12 months is set around $55, with a range from $53 to $58. This reflects a cautious optimism among analysts, suggesting some upside potential given current valuations but tempered by broader market risks.</p>

    <h3>Insider Activity</h3>
<strong>- - Recent Transactions:</strong>
<p>As a passively managed ETF, VEU does not have traditional insider activity as there are no executives making personal trades. Instead, Vanguard acts as the manager. However, periodic adjustments to the fund’s holdings may occur based on market trends and index changes.</p>
<strong>- - Overall Sentiment:</strong>
<p>The sentiment regarding VEU remains largely neutral to positive amongst Vanguard's management, reflecting confidence in the diversified portfolio of international equities it holds.</p>

    <h3>Dividend Analysis</h3>

    <h3>General Sentiment Analysis</h3>

With moderate current performance and a relatively attractive valuation metric, VEU is well-positioned in a diverse portfolio of international stocks.
