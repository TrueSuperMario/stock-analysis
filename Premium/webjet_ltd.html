    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Webjet Ltd has experienced a notable revenue increase of 23% year-on-year, driven primarily by a recovery in travel demand post-pandemic and a strong performance in its hotel distribution segment. However, earnings growth has been more muted at 8%, reflecting ongoing investments in technology and customer acquisition.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
