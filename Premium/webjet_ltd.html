<h3>Current Performance</h3>
<li>**Revenue and Earnings Growth:** As of today, September 22, 2024, Webjet Ltd (WEB) has reported a 12% year-on-year revenue growth, benefiting from a robust recovery in global travel demand post-pandemic.

This is a positive indicator, although it is slightly lower than the industry average, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of the travel and technology enhancements Webjet has invested in.</li>
