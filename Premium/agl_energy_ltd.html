<h3>Current Performance</h3>
<li>**Revenue and Earnings Growth:**</li>
<p>AGL Energy Ltd has reported a mixed performance for the fiscal year. Revenue has seen a decline of 3% year-on-year due to lower electricity prices and decreased demand in some segments.

<li>**Profit Margins:**</li>
<p>Net profit margin stands at 7%, up from 6% last year. The improvement in margins is primarily attributed to successful cost-saving initiatives and a more efficient operational structure.</p>
