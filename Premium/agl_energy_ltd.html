</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>AGL Energy Ltd has reported a revenue decline of approximately 7% year-on-year, primarily attributed to decreased wholesale electricity prices and a reduction in customer numbers. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also fell by 9%, reflecting lower retail margins and ongoing operational challenges.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>The company's net profit margin stands at 5%, which is relatively low for the energy sector, indicating that AGL is navigating significant headwinds, including competitive pricing pressures and higher operational costs. Margins have been squeezed further due to rising costs associated with maintaining legacy infrastructure.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>EPS is currently at $0.45, a decrease of 10% compared to the previous year. The decline underscores the challenges AGL faces in a market increasingly focused on renewable energies and a shift in customer preferences away from traditional energy sources.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>AGL's ROE is currently at 8%, suggesting that the company is generating lower returns on shareholder equity relative to historical performance. This reflects the difficult market conditions and AGL’s transitional phase towards more sustainable energy sources.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
