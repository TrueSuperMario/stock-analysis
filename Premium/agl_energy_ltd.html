</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>AGL Energy Ltd (AGL) has reported a revenue growth of 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by an increase in electricity prices and higher demand across residential and commercial sectors. However, earnings growth was limited to 2%, largely due to rising operational costs and increased capital expenditure on renewable projects, which have somewhat offset the revenue gains.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>AGL’s net profit margin currently stands at 8%, reflecting the company's efforts to manage costs amidst challenging market conditions.

<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>As of the latest financial report, AGL's EPS is $0.65, marking a slight increase of 1.5% from the previous year. This modest growth in EPS signals that while revenue is growing, the company is facing margin compressions which are limiting more substantial earnings growth.</p>
