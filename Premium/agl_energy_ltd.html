</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>AGL Energy Ltd has reported a revenue decline of approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily due to increased competition in the energy market and significant job cuts affecting its operational efficiency. Earnings are under pressure, with net income decreased by about 12%, reflecting higher energy procurement costs and ongoing regulatory compliance expenses.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>The company’s net profit margin currently stands at around 5%, a decrease compared to previous years. This lower margin is attributed to escalating operational costs, particularly in navigating changes in market dynamics and dealing with energy pricing fluctuations.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
