<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<p><strong>- Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong> AGL Energy reported a modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3%, attributed to increased electricity prices and a slight recovery in retail sales post-pandemic. However, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) decreased by 2%, influenced by higher operational costs and maintenance expenditures associated with aging infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>- Profit Margins:</strong> The company’s net profit margin is currently at 8%. This decrease from last year's 10% reflects heightened competition in the retail energy sector, alongside rising input costs that have pressured profitability.</p>
<p><strong>- Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong> AGL's EPS stands at AUD 0.45, representing a 5% decrease from the previous year. This decline mirrors the company's challenges in maintaining profitability amid fluctuating energy prices and increased operational costs.</p>
<p><strong>- Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> The ROE for AGL Energy is reported at 10%, indicating stable yet ordinary utilization of equity in generating profits. This is reflective of the company's attempts to optimize asset management while navigating a challenging market environment.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
