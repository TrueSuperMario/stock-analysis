<p></p>
<p>AGL Energy Ltd has reported a revenue growth of 8% year-on-year, largely driven by increased demand for electricity and gas amid energy transition efforts.

<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>

<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p></p>
<p>AGL’s EPS is currently at AUD 0.65, indicating a slight decline of 1% from the previous year. This drop is attributed to higher costs and operational challenges in adapting to renewable energy standards, yet the company remains focused on improving its operational efficiency.</p>
<strong>- - Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>
<p></p>
