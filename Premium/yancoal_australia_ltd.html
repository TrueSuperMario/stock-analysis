</head>
<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>-  Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Yancoal Australia Ltd (YAL) has demonstrated a substantial revenue growth of 18% year-on-year, fueled by rising coal prices and increased demand in the Asia-Pacific region. However, earnings growth has been less pronounced at around 10%, impacted by rising operational costs and maintenance expenditures in mining operations.</p>
<strong>-  Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>Yancoal's net profit margin currently stands at 12%, a robust figure for the mining industry, albeit lower than the previous year's margin due to higher costs related to labor and equipment. The company's efforts to enhance operational efficiencies have helped counteract some margin compression.</p>
<strong>-  Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>YAL has reported an EPS of $1.85, representing an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year. This reflects the company's ability to maintain profitability despite external cost pressures and fluctuations in coal pricing.</p>
<strong>-  Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
