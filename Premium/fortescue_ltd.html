<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) has reported a year-on-year revenue decline of approximately 10%, primarily due to lower iron ore prices and reduced demand from key markets, particularly China. Earnings have similarly been affected, with a decrease of 12% in net profit, as production costs rise and global market conditions fluctuate.</p>
<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p>FMG's net profit margin stands at 25%, which, while still robust for the mining sector, reflects pressure from decreased commodity prices. The company's ongoing efforts to enhance operational efficiency are aimed at mitigating some of this margin erosion.</p>
