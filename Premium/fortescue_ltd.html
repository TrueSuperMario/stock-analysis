<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p>Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) has reported a revenue of approximately AUD 13 billion for FY 2024, reflecting a 15% year-on-year decline, primarily owing to lower iron ore prices amid a cooling demand from China.

<strong>- - Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>
<p>EPS is presently reported at AUD 1.56, marking a significant decrease from AUD 2.10 in FY 2023. This drop reflects the decline in revenue driven by lower pricing in iron ore exports, which is a primary revenue stream for the company.</p>
