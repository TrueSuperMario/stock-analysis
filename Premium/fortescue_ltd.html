    <h3>Current Performance</h3>
<strong>- - Revenue and Earnings Growth:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) reported a revenue of AUD 15.5 billion for the fiscal year ending June 2024, marking a 12% decrease compared to the previous year. This decline is largely attributed to lower iron ore prices and production interruptions due to adverse weather conditions.

<strong>- - Profit Margins:</strong>
<p></p>
<p>FMG's net profit margin currently stands at 22%. While this figure indicates decent profitability, it has been squeezed by increasing operational costs and fluctuating iron ore prices.

<p></p>
<p>The company’s EPS for the fiscal year is AUD 1.75, a decline of 15% compared to the prior year. This drop reflects the impact of lower sales volumes and pricing pressures, demonstrating the challenges FMG faces in maintaining its earnings amidst fluctuating market dynamics.</p>
