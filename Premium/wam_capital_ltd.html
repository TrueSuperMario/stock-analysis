<body>
    <h3>Current Performance</h3>

Its share price has seen a stable growth trajectory over the past year, reflecting strong portfolio management and market conditions favorable to its investment strategy. The net asset value (NAV) has exhibited an encouraging upward trend, indicating effective capital allocation and investment selection.</p>
<p>WAM's focus on Australian small to mid-cap companies has provided it with significant upside potential, especially given the recovery observed in sectors impacted by the pandemic. Financials, healthcare, and technology stocks within the portfolio have contributed to a notable performance increase, with WAM showing a year-to-date return that outpaces the benchmark index.</p>

    <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
<p>As of late September 2024, WAM Capital Ltd exhibits several noteworthy valuation metrics:</p>
<p>- **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: WAM is trading at a P/E ratio slightly above the sector average, suggesting that investors are willing to pay a premium for its growth prospects.</p>
<p>- **Price to Book (P/B) Ratio**: The current P/B ratio is also higher than industry averages, indicating a strong market perception of the company's value based on its assets.</p>
<p>- **Discount to NAV**: WAM's shares are currently trading at a discount to their NAV, which may present a buying opportunity for investors looking for value in the market.</p>
<p>These metrics suggest that while WAM is valued at a premium compared to its peers, the underlying growth potential and market positioning justify this outlook.</p>
